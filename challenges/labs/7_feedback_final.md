* Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
	* A lot of work, long nights, not enough sleep, headaches
	* course material = cloudera documentation + link-collections
	* The installation part was difficult (?!) - I would have appreciated to have a running Cluster faster than at 02:00 am on Wednesday - I had to work overtime the rest of the time
	* The best solution in my oppinion would have been to at least provide some working disks that could have been attached to get a working clouster to work on on labs and not have to see all the labs pass by and not beeing able to work on them - I have found that really frustrating

* Which topic was least familiar to you?
	* Installing Kerberos

* Which topic was most familiar?
 * getting around on linux
 * yum installations :-)

* Which topic did you feel was most helpful? 
	* Installation -> all the little tweeks and preparations are now known and don't have to be serched for in all the documentation

* Which topic was not useful, if any?
  * I'm sure they will proof useful in some way in the future - it was all pretty new to me so I'm really taking home a lot of new knowledge

* How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself?
	* Maybe half a year if my company gives me some spare time

* What do you need to work on?
	* Install a system that actually gets used to make sure the configuration is really right
	* Connections and Dependencies of all the Service, Agents, Nodes, .... - i did not have too much contact with all those prior to the course
